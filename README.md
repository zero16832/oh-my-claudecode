**Multi-agent orchestration for Claude Code. Zero learning curve.**

*Some advanced users customize zsh for years — most of us just use oh-my-zsh.*
*Don't learn Claude Code. Just use OMC.*

[Get Started](#get-started) • [Documentation](https://yeachan-heo.github.io/oh-my-claudecode-website) • [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION.md)

## Get Started (30 seconds)

**Step 1:** Install the plugin
```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode
/plugin install oh-my-claudecode
```

**Step 2:** Run setup
```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup
```

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

## What Happens Now

| When You... | I Automatically... |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Give me a complex task | Parallelize with specialist agents |
| Say "plan this" | Start a planning interview |
| Say "don't stop until done" | Persist until verified complete |
| Work on UI/frontend | Activate design sensibility |
| Need research or exploration | Delegate to specialized agents |
| Say "build me..." or use autopilot | Execute full autonomous workflow |

**You don't need to learn any commands.** I detect what you need and activate the right behaviors.

---

## Magic Keywords (Power Users)

Want explicit control? Include these words anywhere in your message:

| Keyword | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `ralph` | Persistence mode - won't stop until done |
| `ralplan` | Iterative planning with consensus |
| `ulw` | Maximum parallel execution |
| `plan` | Start a planning interview |
| `autopilot` / `ap` | Full autonomous execution |

**Combine them:** `ralph ulw: migrate the database`

## Data Analysis & Research (v3.3.4)

### Scientist Agent Tiers

Three tiers of scientist agents for quantitative analysis and data science:

| Agent | Model | Use For |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `scientist-low` | Haiku | Quick data inspection, simple statistics, file enumeration |
| `scientist` | Sonnet | Standard analysis, pattern detection, visualization |
| `scientist-high` | Opus | Complex reasoning, hypothesis validation, ML workflows |

**Features:**
- **Persistent Python REPL** - Variables persist across calls (no pickle/reload overhead)
- **Structured markers** - `[FINDING]`, `[STAT:*]`, `[DATA]`, `[LIMITATION]` for parsed output
- **Quality gates** - Every finding requires statistical evidence (CI, effect size, p-value)
- **Auto-visualization** - Charts saved to `.omc/scientist/figures/`
- **Report generation** - Markdown reports with embedded figures

```python
# Variables persist across calls!
python_repl(action="execute", researchSessionID="analysis",
            code="import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')")

# df still exists - no need to reload
python_repl(action="execute", researchSessionID="analysis",
            code="print(df.describe())")
```

### /oh-my-claudecode:research Command (NEW)

Orchestrate parallel scientist agents for comprehensive research workflows:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:research <goal>                    # Standard research with checkpoints
/oh-my-claudecode:research AUTO: <goal>              # Fully autonomous until complete
/oh-my-claudecode:research status                    # Check current session
/oh-my-claudecode:research resume                    # Resume interrupted session
/oh-my-claudecode:research list                      # List all sessions
/oh-my-claudecode:research report <session-id>       # Generate report for session
```

**Research Protocol:**
1. **Decomposition** - Breaks goal into 3-7 independent stages
2. **Parallel Execution** - Fires scientist agents concurrently (max 5)
3. **Cross-Validation** - Verifies consistency across findings
4. **Synthesis** - Generates comprehensive markdown report

**Smart Model Routing:**
- Data gathering tasks → `scientist-low` (Haiku)
- Standard analysis → `scientist` (Sonnet)
- Complex reasoning → `scientist-high` (Opus)

**Session Management:** Research state persists at `.omc/research/{session-id}/` enabling resume after interruption.

## Stopping Things

Just say:
- "stop"
- "cancel"
- "abort"

I'll intelligently determine what to stop based on context.

## What's Under the Hood

- **28 Specialized Agents** - architect, researcher, explore, designer, writer, vision, critic, analyst, executor, planner, qa-tester, scientist (with tier variants)
- **30 Skills** - orchestrate, ultrawork, ralph, planner, deepsearch, deepinit, git-master, frontend-ui-ux, learner, research, and more
- **Persistent Python REPL** - True variable persistence for data analysis
- **Research Workflow** - Parallel scientist orchestration with `/oh-my-claudecode:research` command (new in 3.3.x)
- **HUD Statusline** - Real-time visualization of orchestration state
- **Learned Skills** - Extract reusable insights from sessions with `/oh-my-claudecode:learner`
- **Memory System** - Persistent context that survives compaction

---

## HUD Statusline

The HUD displays real-time orchestration status in Claude Code's status bar:

```
[OMC] | 5h:0% wk:100%(1d6h) | ctx:45% | agents:Ae
todos:3/5 (working: Implementing feature)
```

**Line 1:** Core metrics
- Rate limits with reset times (e.g., `wk:100%(1d6h)` = resets in 1 day 6 hours)
- Context window usage
- Active agents (coded by type and model tier)

**Line 2:** Todo progress
- Completion ratio (`3/5`)
- Current task in progress

Run `/oh-my-claudecode:hud setup` to configure display options.

---

## Coming from 2.x?

**Good news:** Your old commands still work!

```
/oh-my-claudecode:ralph "task"      →  Still works (or just say "ralph: task")
/oh-my-claudecode:ultrawork "task"  →  Still works (or just use "ulw" keyword)
/oh-my-claudecode:planner "task"    →  Still works (or just say "plan this")
```

The difference? You don't *need* them anymore. Everything auto-activates.

See the [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION.md) for details.
