# Hephaestus vs Deep-Executor: Comparative Analysis

## Analysis Summary
- **Research Question**: How do the Hephaestus (oh-my-opencode) and Deep-Executor (oh-my-claudecode) agent architectures differ, and what can each learn from the other?
- **Methodology**: Structured feature comparison across 14 capability dimensions, scored 0-3

---

## 1. Architectural Overview

| Dimension | Hephaestus | Deep-Executor |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Core Philosophy** | Conductor/Delegator | Self-Contained Forge |
| **Execution Model** | Multi-agent parallel | Single-agent sequential |
| **Agent Spawning** | 2-5 parallel background agents | BLOCKED (by design) |
| **Tool Strategy** | Agents as tools | Direct MCP/LSP tools |
| **Model** | GPT 5.2 with reasoning levels | Claude (Opus/Sonnet) |

### Key Insight
These are fundamentally different architectural paradigms. Hephaestus is a **distributed system** -- it treats agents as microservices. Deep-Executor is a **monolith** -- it concentrates all capability in one process. Neither is inherently superior; they optimize for different constraints.

```

### 2.1 Parallel Exploration (Gap: 3/3)

**Hephaestus**: Fires 2-5 explore/librarian agents simultaneously as background tasks. Continues working while results stream in. Uses `background_output(task_id)` to collect.

**Deep-Executor**: Sequential exploration only. Must complete each Glob/Grep/Read call before starting the next.

**Impact**: For large codebases, Hephaestus can gather context 3-5x faster. Deep-Executor compensates with more targeted, cheaper queries but loses wall-clock time on broad searches.

### 2.2 Delegation to Specialists (Gap: 3/3)

**Hephaestus**: Three specialized agent types:
- **Explore agents**: Parallel codebase search
- **Librarian**: External docs, GitHub, OSS research
- **Oracle**: High-IQ consulting for stuck situations

**Deep-Executor**: No delegation. All work is self-performed. This is a deliberate design choice ("You are the forge") but means no access to specialist capabilities.

**Impact**: Hephaestus can handle broader task scopes. Deep-Executor is limited to what a single agent context window can reason about.

### 2.3 External Research Capability (Gap: 3/3)

**Hephaestus**: Librarian agent fetches external documentation, GitHub repos, and OSS references. This provides real-time knowledge augmentation.

**Deep-Executor**: No external research capability. Relies entirely on pre-loaded context and available tools.

**Impact**: When working with unfamiliar APIs or libraries, Hephaestus has a significant advantage.

### 2.4 Failure Recovery / Escalation (Gap: 2/3)

**Hephaestus**: Structured 3-failure protocol: STOP -> REVERT -> DOCUMENT -> CONSULT Oracle. Clear escalation path prevents infinite retry loops.

**Deep-Executor**: No explicit failure threshold or escalation. Has verification loops but no "give up and escalate" mechanism.

**Impact**: Hephaestus avoids wasting tokens on unrecoverable situations. Deep-Executor can get stuck in retry loops.

### 2.5 Dynamic Prompt Adaptation (Gap: 3/3)

**Hephaestus**: Uses helper functions (`buildExploreSection()`, etc.) to dynamically construct prompts based on available capabilities. Prompt adapts to runtime environment.

**Deep-Executor**: Static prompt. Same instructions regardless of available tools or context.

**Impact**: Hephaestus is more portable across environments with varying tool availability.

### 2.6 Reasoning Level Configuration (Gap: 3/3)

**Hephaestus**: Explicit reasoning budget per task type (MEDIUM for code changes, HIGH for complex refactoring). "ROUTER NUDGE" directs model thinking depth.

**Deep-Executor**: No reasoning level control. Same approach for all task complexities.

**Impact**: Hephaestus can optimize cost/quality tradeoff per subtask.

---

## 3. Inverse Gaps: What Deep-Executor Has That Hephaestus Could Benefit From

### 3.1 TODO Discipline (Gap: 2/3)

**Deep-Executor**: NON-NEGOTIABLE rules: TodoWrite for 2+ steps, ONE in_progress at a time, mark completed IMMEDIATELY. This creates a reliable audit trail and prevents task drift.

**Hephaestus**: Minimal task tracking. Relies on delegation structure rather than explicit progress tracking.

**Recommendation for Hephaestus**: Adopt mandatory task tracking for complex multi-step operations.

### 3.2 Verification Protocol Rigor (Gap: 2/3)

**Deep-Executor**: After EVERY change: `lsp_diagnostics`. Before completion: ALL of (todos, tests, build, diagnostics). Specified evidence format.

**Hephaestus**: No structured verification protocol. Delegates verification implicitly through agent results.

**Recommendation for Hephaestus**: Add post-change diagnostic checks and a completion checklist.

### 3.3 MCP/LSP Tool Strategy (Gap: 2/3)

**Deep-Executor**: Explicit strategy for `lsp_diagnostics` (single file), `lsp_diagnostics_directory` (project-wide), `ast_grep_search/replace` with dryRun protocol. Clear escalation from file to project scope.

**Hephaestus**: No explicit LSP/AST tool strategy documented.

**Recommendation for Hephaestus**: Document and enforce a tool selection hierarchy.

### 3.4 Token Efficiency (Gap: 2/3)

**Deep-Executor**: Single agent = single context window. No inter-agent communication overhead. No prompt duplication across spawned agents.

**Hephaestus**: Each spawned agent carries its own system prompt + context. 2-5 parallel agents means 2-5x prompt overhead. Background task management adds coordination tokens.

**Estimated overhead**: Hephaestus uses ~2-4x more tokens per exploration phase due to agent spawning costs.

### 3.5 Self-Sufficiency (Gap: 2/3)

**Deep-Executor**: Works in any environment. No dependency on agent infrastructure, background task systems, or multi-agent coordination. Degrades gracefully.

**Hephaestus**: Depends on delegation infrastructure. If agent spawning fails, core workflow breaks.

## 4. Token Efficiency Analysis

| Operation | Hephaestus (est. tokens) | Deep-Executor (est. tokens) | Ratio |
|-----------|------------------------:|---------------------------:|------:|
| System prompt per agent | ~3,000 | ~3,000 (once) | 1:1 |
| 3 parallel explore agents | ~9,000 prompt + ~6,000 output | ~2,000 (sequential Grep/Glob) | 7.5:1 |
| Librarian research call | ~4,000 prompt + ~2,000 output | N/A (not available) | - |
| Oracle consultation | ~5,000 prompt + ~3,000 output | N/A (not available) | - |
| Coordination overhead | ~1,000 per delegation | 0 | - |
| **Typical task total** | **~30,000-50,000** | **~10,000-20,000** | **~2.5:1** |

**Conclusion**: Deep-Executor is approximately 2-3x more token-efficient for equivalent tasks. Hephaestus trades tokens for wall-clock speed and broader capability.

## 5. Architectural Tradeoffs

### Delegation Model (Hephaestus)

**Strengths**:
- Parallel execution reduces wall-clock time
- Specialist agents can be individually optimized
- External research augments knowledge
- Failure escalation prevents waste

**Weaknesses**:
- Higher token cost (2-3x)
- Coordination complexity
- Context fragmentation across agents
- Infrastructure dependency

### Self-Contained Model (Deep-Executor)

**Strengths**:
- Token efficient
- No coordination overhead
- Unified context (no information loss between agents)
- Portable and infrastructure-independent
- Strong verification discipline

**Weaknesses**:
- Sequential exploration (slower wall-clock)
- No escalation path when stuck
- No external research
- Cannot parallelize independent subtasks
- Single point of failure (one agent context limit)

## 6. Prioritized Improvement Recommendations for Deep-Executor

### Priority 1: Failure Recovery Protocol (HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

Add a structured failure threshold:
```
After 3 consecutive failures on same task:
1. STOP current approach
2. DOCUMENT what was tried and why it failed
3. Try fundamentally different approach
4. If still failing: report to orchestrator with evidence
```

This requires NO delegation infrastructure -- just self-discipline rules.

### Priority 2: Exploration Batching (HIGH IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)

While true parallel agents are blocked, Deep-Executor can batch exploration:
```
- Issue multiple Glob/Grep calls in a single turn (already possible)
- Structure 5 exploration questions upfront (already present)
- Add explicit "exploration budget" (max N tool calls before proceeding)
```

Ensure the agent always issues independent Glob/Grep/Read calls in parallel within a single response.

### Priority 3: Reasoning Depth Hints (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

Add task-complexity classification to control thoroughness:
```
SIMPLE (< 1 file, < 20 lines): Quick fix, minimal exploration
MEDIUM (1-3 files, < 100 lines): Standard exploration + verification
COMPLEX (3+ files, architectural): Full exploration + multiple verification passes
```

### Priority 4: Dynamic Tool Adaptation (MEDIUM IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)

Add capability detection:
```
IF lsp_diagnostics available: use for verification
ELSE IF build command known: use build output
ELSE: rely on ast_grep_search for structural validation
```

### Priority 5: Structured Escalation Reporting (LOW IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)

When stuck, produce a structured failure report:
```
## Escalation Report
- **Task**: What was attempted
- **Attempts**: What approaches were tried (with outcomes)
- **Blocker**: Why it cannot be resolved
- **Suggested Next Steps**: What a human or orchestrator should try
```

### For Hephaestus Enhancements (Inverse)

| Enhancement | Implementation | Effort |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| TODO discipline | Port Deep-Executor's TodoWrite rules | 1 hour |
| Verification protocol | Add post-change lsp_diagnostics mandate | 1 hour |
| LSP tool strategy | Document tool selection hierarchy | 2 hours |

## 8. Conclusion

Hephaestus and Deep-Executor represent two valid points on the agent architecture spectrum:

- **Hephaestus** optimizes for **capability breadth and speed** at the cost of token efficiency
- **Deep-Executor** optimizes for **reliability and efficiency** at the cost of parallelism

The most impactful improvements for Deep-Executor are those that require NO architectural changes: failure recovery protocols, exploration batching, and complexity-aware reasoning. These can be implemented purely through prompt engineering within the existing self-contained model.

The most impactful improvements for Hephaestus are Deep-Executor's discipline mechanisms: TODO tracking, verification protocols, and structured completion contracts. These add reliability without sacrificing Hephaestus's delegation strengths.
