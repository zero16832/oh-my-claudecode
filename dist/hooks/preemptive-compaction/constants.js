Your context usage is getting high. Consider these actions to prevent hitting the limit:

1. USE COMPACT COMMAND
   - Run /compact to summarize the conversation
   - This frees up context space while preserving important information

2. BE MORE CONCISE
   - Show only relevant code portions
   - Use file paths instead of full code blocks
   - Summarize instead of repeating information

3. FOCUS YOUR REQUESTS
   - Work on one task at a time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Avoid unnecessary back-and-forth

Current Status: Context usage is high but recoverable.
Action recommended: Use /compact when convenient.

/**
 * Critical warning message when context is almost full
 */
export const CONTEXT_CRITICAL_MESSAGE = `CRITICAL: CONTEXT WINDOW ALMOST FULL

Your context usage is critically high. Immediate action required:

1. COMPACT NOW
   - Run /compact immediately to summarize the conversation
   - Without compaction, the next few messages may fail

2. AVOID LARGE OUTPUTS
   - Do not show full files
   - Use summaries instead of detailed outputs
   - Be as concise as possible

3. PREPARE FOR SESSION HANDOFF
   - If compaction doesn't help enough, prepare to continue in a new session
   - Note your current progress and next steps

WARNING: Further messages may fail if context is not reduced.
Action required: Run /compact now.
