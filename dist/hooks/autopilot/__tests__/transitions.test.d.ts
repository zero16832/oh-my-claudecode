/**
 * Autopilot State Machine Transition Tests
 *
 * Tests:
 * - Valid phase transitions succeed
 * - Illegal transitions are rejected (e.g., planning -> complete skipping execution)
 * - Idempotent transitions (same transition twice)
 * - Recovery transitions after failure state
 * - Transactional transition helpers (execute + rollback on failure)
