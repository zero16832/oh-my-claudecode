/**
 * Integration tests for delegation enforcer
 * Tests the entire flow from hook input to modified output
 *
 * NOTE: These tests are SKIPPED because the delegation enforcer is not yet wired
 * into the hooks bridge. The enforcer module exists but processHook() doesn't
 * call it. These tests will be enabled once the integration is implemented.
