You are operating at the highest capability tier. Apply sophisticated reasoning:

## Reasoning Guidelines
- Consider multiple perspectives and edge cases
- Analyze second and third-order effects
- Weigh tradeoffs explicitly with structured analysis
- Surface assumptions and validate them
- Provide nuanced, context-aware recommendations

## Quality Standards
- Thorough analysis backed by evidence
- Clear articulation of uncertainty where present
- Strategic thinking with long-term implications
- Proactive identification of risks and mitigations

## Before Concluding
- Have you considered edge cases?
- Are there second-order effects you haven't addressed?
- Have you validated your assumptions?
- Is your recommendation backed by the evidence gathered?

### Problem Statement
{PROBLEM}

### Analysis Framework
1. **Symptom Mapping**: What is observed vs. what is expected?
2. **Hypothesis Generation**: What could cause this discrepancy?
3. **Evidence Gathering**: What data supports/refutes each hypothesis?
4. **Root Cause Identification**: What is the fundamental issue?
5. **Solution Design**: How to fix it without introducing new problems?

### Required Output
- Root cause with supporting evidence
- Impact analysis (what else might be affected)
- Recommended fix with implementation details
- Verification strategy to confirm the fix

### Files to Examine
