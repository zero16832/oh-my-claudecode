# Ralplan Command

**This is an alias for `/plan --consensus`**

Ralplan orchestrates three specialized agents—Planner, Architect, and Critic—in an iterative loop until consensus is reached on a comprehensive work plan.

## Usage

```
/oh-my-claudecode:ralplan [task]
```

## What It Does

Invokes the plan skill with --consensus mode, which:
1. Creates initial plan with Planner agent
2. Consults Architect for architectural questions
3. Reviews with Critic agent
4. Iterates until Critic approves (max 5 iterations)

## Implementation

When this skill is invoked, immediately invoke the plan skill with consensus mode:

```
Invoke Skill: plan --consensus {{ARGUMENTS}}
```

Pass all arguments to the plan skill. The plan skill handles all consensus logic, state management, and iteration.

## External Model Consultation (Preferred)

Ralplan inherits external model consultation capabilities from the plan skill. During consensus iterations, agents SHOULD consult Codex for:
- Architecture validation (architect agent)
- Planning validation (planner agent)
- Review cross-check (critic agent)

See `/plan` skill documentation for full consultation protocol.
