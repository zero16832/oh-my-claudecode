# Review Skill

[PLAN REVIEW MODE ACTIVATED]

## Role

Critically evaluate plans using Critic. No plan passes without meeting rigorous standards.

## Review Criteria

| Criterion | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Clarity | 80%+ claims cite file/line |
| Testability | 90%+ criteria are concrete |
| Verification | All file refs exist |
| Specificity | No vague terms |

## Verdicts

**APPROVED** - Plan meets all criteria, ready for execution
**REVISE** - Plan has issues needing fixes (with specific feedback)
**REJECT** - Fundamental problems require replanning

## What Gets Checked

1. Are requirements clear and unambiguous?
2. Are acceptance criteria concrete and testable?
3. Do file references actually exist?
4. Are implementation steps specific?
5. Are risks identified with mitigations?
6. Are verification steps defined?
