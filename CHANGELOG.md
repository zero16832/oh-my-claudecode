# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.9.9] - Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- **Node.js 20 Required** - Minimum Node.js version increased from 18 to 20. Users on Node.js 18 must upgrade before using this version. This aligns with Node.js LTS schedule (Node 18 EOL: April 2025).

### Performance

- **Levenshtein LRU Cache** - Added LRU cache for Levenshtein distance calculations in skill matching with canonical key ordering for maximum cache hits
- **Skill Metadata Cache** - Added 30-second TTL cache for skill metadata to reduce repeated file system reads
- **Debounced State Writes** - Subagent tracker now batches state file writes with 100ms debounce to reduce I/O
- **Pre-compiled Regex Patterns** - Pre-compiled 15+ regex patterns in hot paths (auto-learner, live-data, bridge) to eliminate repeated compilation
- **Parallel State File Reads** - Pre-compact module now reads all state files in parallel using Promise.all
- **Session Index Caching** - Token tracker now caches session indices with 5-minute TTL for 50-100ms faster stats loading
- **Space-Optimized Levenshtein** - Levenshtein algorithm now uses O(n) space instead of O(n²)

### Fixed

- **Per-Directory Debounce** - Fixed race condition in subagent tracker where global debounce state could lose writes for different directories
- **TOCTOU Race Condition** - Fixed time-of-check-time-of-use race in pre-compact by removing existsSync check before async read
- **True LRU Cache** - Fixed Levenshtein cache to use true LRU eviction (delete+reinsert on hit) instead of FIFO
- **Session Index Off-by-One** - Fixed off-by-one error in token tracker session index offset calculation

---

## [3.9.7] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- **Stop Hook Freeze on Bash Errors** (#321, fixes #319) - Fixed persistent-mode hook causing session freezes when bash commands encounter errors. The root cause was cascading errors in the catch block when stdout/stderr streams were broken:
  - Replaced `console.log`/`console.error` with `process.stdout.write`/`process.stderr.write` in error handlers
  - Added nested try-catch blocks to handle EPIPE and broken pipe errors gracefully
  - Added global `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection` handlers to prevent hook hangs
  - Added 10-second safety timeout to force exit if hook doesn't complete
  - Added early return for invalid JSON input to prevent unnecessary processing
  - Hook now guarantees to return `{ continue: true }` even on catastrophic errors

- **Invalid Hook Event Type** (#322, fixes #320) - Renamed invalid 'Setup' hook event to 'SessionStart' in hooks.json. The 'Setup' event type is not recognized by Claude Code's hook system. All hooks moved into SessionStart where they belong.

- **Project-Scoped Plugin Isolation** (#315, fixes #314) - Fixed project-scoped plugin installations incorrectly modifying global scope. When installing OMC as a project-scoped plugin (in `.claude/plugins/`), the installer was incorrectly modifying global `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude/hud/`, causing the statusline and plugin to appear in all projects:
  - Added `isProjectScopedPlugin()` detection function
  - Skip HUD statusline installation for project-scoped plugins
  - Skip settings.json modification for project-scoped plugins
  - Skip version metadata file for project-scoped plugins
  - Skip global config directory creation for project-scoped plugins
  - Added comprehensive tests for project-scoped detection

- **Auto-Update Trigger on Session Start** (#316, fixes #298) - Fixed silent auto-update feature not being triggered. The `silentAutoUpdate()` function existed but was never called. Now properly imports and calls `initSilentAutoUpdate()` in `processSessionStart()` so update checks run on session start when the user has opted in.

- **Session Isolation + Windows Path Handling** (#317) - Fixed session isolation and Windows path compatibility issues. Improved session ID handling across 14 files to prevent state conflicts between concurrent sessions, with proper Windows path normalization (contributed by @MeroZemory).

---

## [3.9.2] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Bash History Integration** (Issue #290) - Claude Code bash commands are now automatically appended to `~/.bash_history`, allowing users to recall them with arrow keys or Ctrl+R in their terminal. Enabled by default; disable with `"bashHistory": false` in `~/.claude/.omc-config.json`.

---

## [3.9.1] - 2026-02-01

### Changed

- **Framework-Agnostic Prompts** - All agent prompts, skill files, and TypeScript source code now use generic, language-neutral commands instead of hardcoded npm/Node.js-specific commands. This makes OMC work seamlessly with any project type (Python, Go, Rust, Java, etc.).

### Files Updated

**Agent Prompts:**

- `agents/deep-executor.md` - Generic verification evidence placeholders
- `agents/architect.md` - Generic project manifest and build references

**Skill Files:**

- `skills/build-fix/SKILL.md` - Generic type check and build command references
- `skills/ultrawork/SKILL.md` - Generic background task examples
- `skills/ralph/SKILL.md` - Generic background task examples
- `skills/ultraqa/SKILL.md` - Generic goal command references
- `skills/tdd/SKILL.md` - Generic test command references

## [3.8.17] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed

- **MCP Tool Name Length** (PR #252, fixes #241, #232, #235) - Shortened MCP server name from `omc-tools` to `t` to fix tool names exceeding the 64-character API limit. The longest tool name (`lsp_diagnostics_directory`) now uses 57 characters instead of 65.

---

## [3.8.16] - 2026-02-01

### Changed

- **Local-Only State Management** - All execution mode state (ralph, ultrawork, ecomode) is now stored exclusively in `.omc/state/` per project/worktree. Global state in `~/.claude/` and `~/.omc/state/` is no longer written for mode state, enabling multiple git worktrees to run OMC simultaneously without state conflicts. Existing global state is migrated on first read.
- **Promise Pattern Removal** - Fully removed `<promise>` completion pattern from ralph and verification workflows. Completion now uses architect verification + `/oh-my-claudecode:cancel` for clean exit.

### Added

- **HUD CWD Element** (#229) - Configurable working directory display in HUD with three formats: relative, absolute, folder.
- **HUD Thinking Indicator** (#229) - Configurable thinking indicator with four formats: bubble, brain, face, text.
- **HUD Line Limiting** (#228) - Prevents HUD output from shrinking the input field.
- **HUD Stale Task Threshold** (#236) - Configurable `staleTaskThresholdMinutes` option.
- **Session End Hook** - New hook for proper state cleanup on session termination, preventing stale state from causing stop hook malfunctions.
- **Learner Parser Backward Compatibility** (#227) - Backward-compatible parser for legacy skill files with auto-generated IDs and default source field.

### Fixed

- **Stop Hook Not Blocking** (PR #237, fixes #233) - Fixed persistent-mode Stop hook using `{ continue: true }` instead of `{ decision: "block" }`.
- **Completion Promise Checking** (#239) - Added completion promise checking to Ultrawork and Ecomode stop hooks.
- **Staleness Check** - Added staleness check and session-end cleanup for mode states.

---

## [3.8.15] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- **Stop Hook Not Blocking** (PR #237, fixes #233) - Fixed persistent-mode Stop hook using `{ continue: true }` instead of `{ decision: "block" }`. The old approach was a no-op that always allowed stops instead of blocking them. All 8 mode handlers (ralph, autopilot, ultrapilot, swarm, pipeline, ultraqa, ultrawork, ecomode) now properly block premature stops.

---

## [3.8.14] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Bun Package Manager Support** (PR #219) - OMC setup now prefers Bun over npm when available, with automatic fallback. Includes duplicate cleanup logic and per-manager verification.
- **MCP Skill Loading Tools** (PR #225) - Three new MCP tools (`load_omc_skills_local`, `load_omc_skills_global`, `list_omc_skills`) with 5-layer security hardening: path validation, symlink boundary checks, depth limits, content sanitization, and relative path output.

### Fixed

- **HUD OAuth Token Refresh** (PR #206) - Expired OAuth tokens now auto-refresh using RFC 6749 compliant refresh token grant, restoring rate limit display. Credentials persisted with atomic writes and 0o600 permissions.

---

## [3.8.10] - 2026-01-30

### Deprecated

- **Coordinator Agent** - `coordinatorAgent` and `ORCHESTRATOR_SISYPHUS_PROMPT_METADATA` are deprecated and will be removed in v4.0.0. The coordinator agent was never registered in the runtime agent registry and had zero internal consumers. Deprecated stubs are provided for backward compatibility.

### Fixed

- **Documentation Consistency** - Fixed misleading "Combine them" multi-skill documentation
  - Clarified that ralph includes ultrawork automatically
  - Updated 7 documentation files with accurate skill composition guidance
- **Skill Count** - Fixed documented skill count from 35 to 37 across all documentation
- **Missing Agent Exports** - Fixed 9 missing agent exports from index.ts:
  - `explore-high`, `security-reviewer`, `security-reviewer-low`
  - `build-fixer`, `build-fixer-low`
  - `tdd-guide`, `tdd-guide-low`
  - `code-reviewer`, `code-reviewer-low`

### Changed

- **Agent Prompt Architecture** - Migrated all 12 base agent prompts from hardcoded TypeScript constants to dynamic loading from markdown files
  - Implemented `loadAgentPrompt()` utility function for runtime prompt loading
  - Moved utility to `src/agents/utils.ts` to avoid circular dependency issues
  - Affected agents: planner, architect, executor, explore, researcher, designer, writer, qa-tester, vision, critic, analyst, scientist
- **Agent Prompt Enhancement** - Enhanced agent prompts with improved instructions and domain-specific guidance. Prompts are now maintained as standalone markdown files in `agents/`.
- **Public API** - `loadAgentPrompt()` is now exported from the main entry point for external consumers
- **Model Routing** - Removed dead coordinator references and `isFixedTierAgent()` function (was only used for deprecated coordinator)
- **Task Decomposer** - Renamed `requiresCoordinator` to `requiresOrchestration` in SharedFile type
- **Documentation Enhancement** - Added "Choosing the Right Mode" decision tree to clarify execution mode selection
- **State Management** - Standardized path documentation for state files across all modes

### Added

- **CI Validation Tests** - New comprehensive validation tests for agent registry
  - Validates agent count, markdown file presence, exports, and absence of hardcoded prompts
  - Prevents regressions in agent configuration

## [3.5.1] - 2026-01-24

### Added

#### Learned Skills Auto-Matching & Invocation System

Smart skill matching with fuzzy matching, pattern detection, and auto-invocation for learned skills.

- **Skill Matcher** (`src/hooks/learner/matcher.ts`)
  - Fuzzy matching using Levenshtein distance
  - Glob and regex pattern support for triggers
  - Context extraction (errors, files, code patterns)
  - Confidence scoring (0-100) for match quality

- **Auto-Learner** (`src/hooks/learner/auto-learner.ts`)
  - Pattern detection from problem-solution pairs
  - Skill worthiness scoring algorithm
  - Auto-trigger extraction from conversation context
  - Suggestion threshold (70+ confidence)

- **Auto-Invoke** (`src/hooks/learner/auto-invoke.ts`)
  - High-confidence auto-invocation (80+ threshold)
  - Session tracking with cooldown to prevent spam
  - Success/failure analytics for learning

- **New Skills**
  - `local-skills-setup` - Guided wizard for skill directory setup and management
  - `skill` - CLI commands for list/add/remove/edit/search/sync local skills

- **90 new tests** for matcher, auto-learner edge cases, security, and performance

#### Analytics Backfill System

Complete offline transcript analysis pipeline for token usage and cost tracking.

- **Transcript Scanner** (`src/analytics/transcript-scanner.ts`)
  - Scans `~/.claude/projects/` for session JSONL files
  - Smart path decoding handles hyphenated directory names
  - Project filtering and date range support

- **Transcript Parser** (`src/analytics/transcript-parser.ts`)
  - Streaming JSONL parser with AbortSignal support
  - Memory-efficient line-by-line processing
  - Graceful handling of malformed entries

- **Token Extractor** (`src/analytics/transcript-token-extractor.ts`)
  - Extracts token usage from both `assistant` and `progress` entry types
  - **Proper agent attribution**: Progress entries (actual agent responses) correctly attributed via `parentToolUseID` → `toolUseId` lookup
  - Model normalization (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 → claude-sonnet-4.5)
  - Haiku model detection from progress entries
  - Skips `<synthetic>` model entries

- **Backfill Engine** (`src/analytics/backfill-engine.ts`)
  - Orchestrates the full pipeline: scan → parse → extract → deduplicate → store
  - Progress events for UI feedback
  - Batch processing with configurable batch size
  - Dry-run mode for testing

- **Backfill Deduplication** (`src/analytics/backfill-dedup.ts`)
  - SHA256-based entry ID generation for consistent deduplication
  - Persistent state in `~/.omc/state/backfill-state.json`
  - Prevents duplicate entries on re-runs

- **CLI Command** (`omc backfill`)
  - Progress bar with real-time stats
  - Options: `--project`, `--from`, `--to`, `--dry-run`, `--verbose`
  - Auto-backfill on first `omc stats` run

- **Global Token Tracking**
  - All token data stored globally in `~/.omc/state/` (not per-project)
  - Cross-session aggregate statistics via `getAllStats()`
  - Proper "(main session)" attribution for non-agent token usage

- **Documentation** (`docs/ANALYTICS-SYSTEM.md`)
  - Complete system architecture documentation
  - Data flow diagrams and file format specifications

### Fixed

- **Agent Cost Attribution**: Previously spawned agent costs were hidden in "(main session)" because progress entries weren't properly attributed. Now correctly shows:
  - Main session: ~60% of cost (direct user interactions)
  - Spawned agents: ~40% of cost (delegated work)

- **Haiku Model Detection**: Haiku responses stored as `type: "progress"` entries with nested `data.message.message.usage` are now properly detected

- **Model Name Normalization**: Handles full model names (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) and normalizes to pricing tiers

### Technical Details

**Agent Attribution Fix:**

```
Before: Assistant entries with Task calls → incorrectly attributed to agent
        Progress entries (actual agent work) → hidden in "(main session)"

After:  Assistant entries → correctly attributed to "(main session)"
        Progress entries → correctly attributed via parentToolUseID lookup
```

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-20

### 🎨 Complete Rebrand - From Mythology to Intuition

This is a **breaking release** that renames the entire project and all agent names for clarity and accessibility.

### Breaking Changes

- **Project Renamed**: Project renamed to `oh-my-claudecode`
  - npm package remains `oh-my-claude-sisyphus`: `npx oh-my-claude-sisyphus install`
  - Plugin name is `oh-my-claudecode` for Claude Code integration

- **Agent Names Changed**: Greek mythology → Intuitive names
  - `prometheus` → `planner` (strategic planning)
  - `momus` → `critic` (plan review)
  - `oracle` → `architect` (architecture & debugging)
  - `metis` → `analyst` (pre-planning analysis)
  - `mnemosyne` → `learner` (learned skills system)
  - `sisyphus-junior` → `executor` (focused execution)
  - `librarian` → `researcher` (documentation research)
  - `frontend-engineer` → `designer` (UI/UX work)
  - `document-writer` → `writer` (technical documentation)
  - `multimodal-looker` → `vision` (visual analysis)
  - `orchestrator-sisyphus` → `orchestrator` (task coordination)

- **Directory Structure**: `.sisyphus/` → `.omc/` (oh-my-claudecode)
  - State files now in `~/.claude/.omc/`
  - Runtime plans in `.omc/plans/`
  - Session notes in `.omc/notepads/`

- **Environment Variables**: `SISYPHUS_*` → `OMC_*`
  - All environment variable prefixes updated for consistency

- **Slash Commands Updated**: Agent-referencing commands now use new names
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:plan` now uses `planner` agent (was `prometheus`)
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:review` now uses `critic` agent (was `momus`)
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:mnemosyne` → `/oh-my-claudecode:learner` for skill extraction

### Migration Guide

For existing users upgrading from 2.x:

1. **Reinstall**: Run `npx oh-my-claude-sisyphus install` to update hooks and configs
2. **State Migration**: Old `.sisyphus/` directories will continue to work, but new state saves to `.omc/`
3. **Agent References**: Update any custom scripts/configs that referenced old agent names
4. **Environment Variables**: Rename any `SISYPHUS_*` variables to `OMC_*`

### Rationale

The Greek mythology naming convention, while elegant, created barriers for new users:

- Non-obvious agent purposes ("What does Prometheus do?")
- Cultural accessibility concerns
- Increased cognitive load for remembering agent roles

The new intuitive names (`planner`, `architect`, `critic`) make the system immediately understandable.

### Note on Historical Entries

All changelog entries below v3.0.0 reference the old names (`prometheus`, `sisyphus-junior`, etc.) - this is intentional and accurate for those versions.

  - Interactive CLI testing using tmux sessions
  - Prerequisite checking (tmux availability, server connections)
  - Structured test execution workflow
  - Oracle → QA-Tester diagnostic loop pattern

- **Smart Gating for qa-tester** in ultrawork/skills
  - Prefer standard test suites over qa-tester when available
  - Use qa-tester only when interactive testing is truly needed
  - Token-efficient verification decisions

- **Adaptive Routing for qa-tester**
  - Simple verification → Haiku
  - Interactive testing → Sonnet
  - Complex integration → Opus

### Changed

- Updated ultrawork skill with verification protocol and qa-tester gating
- Updated ralph-loop and orchestrator with qa-tester integration
- Updated sisyphus command with Agent Combinations section

### Refactored

- **Merged sisyphus+orchestrator+ultrawork into default mode** - 80% behavior overlap consolidated

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-01-13

### 🚀 Revolutionary: Intelligent Model Routing

**This is a major release introducing adaptive model routing for all agents.**

The orchestrator (Opus) now analyzes task complexity BEFORE delegation and routes to the appropriate model tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus). This dramatically improves efficiency - simple tasks use faster, cheaper models while complex tasks get the full power of Opus.

### Added

- **Intelligent Model Routing System** (`src/features/model-routing/`)
  - `types.ts`: Core types for routing (ComplexityTier, RoutingDecision, etc.)
  - `signals.ts`: Complexity signal extraction (lexical, structural, context)
  - `scorer.ts`: Weighted scoring system for complexity calculation
  - `rules.ts`: Priority-based routing rules engine
  - `router.ts`: Main routing logic with `getModelForTask()` API
  - `prompts/`: Tier-specific prompt adaptations (opus.ts, sonnet.ts, haiku.ts)

- **Adaptive Routing for ALL Agents**
  - Only orchestrators are fixed to Opus (they analyze and delegate)
  - All other agents adapt based on task complexity:
    - `oracle`: lookup → Haiku, tracing → Sonnet, debugging → Opus
    - `prometheus`: breakdown → Haiku, planning → Sonnet, strategic → Opus
    - `momus`: checklist → Haiku, gap analysis → Sonnet, adversarial → Opus
    - `metis`: impact → Haiku, deps → Sonnet, risk analysis → Opus
    - `explore`: simple search → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `document-writer`: simple docs → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `sisyphus-junior`: simple fix → Haiku, module work → Sonnet, risky → Opus

- **Complexity Signal Detection**
  - Lexical: word count, keywords (architecture, debugging, risk, simple)
  - Structural: subtask count, cross-file deps, impact scope, reversibility
  - Context: previous failures, conversation depth, plan complexity

- **Tiered Prompt Adaptations**
  - Haiku: Concise, direct prompts for speed
  - Sonnet: Balanced prompts for efficiency
  - Opus: Deep reasoning prompts with thinking mode

### Changed

- **Orchestrator Prompts** updated with intelligent routing guidance
- **Configuration** (`src/config/loader.ts`) now includes routing options
- **Types** (`src/shared/types.ts`) extended with routing configuration

### Breaking Changes

- Routing is now proactive (orchestrator decides upfront) instead of reactive
- Deprecated `routeWithEscalation()` - use `getModelForTask()` instead

### Migration Guide

No action needed - the system automatically routes based on complexity. To override:

```typescript
Task(
  (subagent_type = "oracle"),
  (model = "opus"),
  (prompt = "Force Opus for this task"),
);
```

## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **Enhanced Hook Enforcement System** - Stronger Sisyphus behavior enforcement beyond CLAUDE.md
  - `pre-tool-enforcer.sh`: PreToolUse hook that injects contextual Sisyphus reminders before every tool execution
  - `post-tool-verifier.sh`: PostToolUse hook for verification after tools, with failure detection
  - Enhanced `persistent-mode.sh`: Stop hook now includes build/test/git/background task verification
  - `claude-sisyphus.sh`: CLI wrapper that uses `--append-system-prompt` for direct system prompt injection
  - `sisyphus-aliases.sh`: Shell aliases (`claude-s`, `claudew`) for easy activation

### Changed

- **Stop Hook** now enforces additional verification requirements:
  - Build verification (if build scripts exist)
  - Test verification (if tests exist)
  - Git status check (warns on uncommitted changes)
  - Background task completion check
  - All previous checks (Ralph Loop, Ultrawork, Todo completion)

- **Hook Configuration** - Added PreToolUse and PostToolUse to `hooks.json`

### Technical Details

- PreToolUse hook provides tool-specific reminders (Bash, Task, Edit, Write, Read, Grep/Glob)
- PostToolUse hook tracks session statistics in `~/.claude/.session-stats.json`
- Stop hook returns `continue: false` until ALL verification requirements are met
- CLI wrapper appends core Sisyphus rules directly to Claude's system prompt

### Enforcement Hierarchy

1. **Stop Hook** with `continue: false` - Blocks ALL stopping until verified
2. **PreToolUse** - Injects reminders BEFORE every tool
3. **PostToolUse** - Verifies AFTER every tool
4. **CLI Wrapper** - Appends rules to system prompt

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-11

  - Conventional commit message validation
  - TypeScript type checking integration
  - Test runner detection and execution
  - Pre-commit validation workflow

### Changed

- **Bridge Module** - Added persistent-mode and session-start hook handlers
- **Keyword Detector** - Now activates ultrawork state when ultrawork keyword is detected
- **Settings Configuration** - Added SessionStart hook configuration for both Bash and Node.js

### Technical Details

- New hooks: `persistent-mode.sh/.mjs`, `session-start.sh/.mjs`
- State files: `.sisyphus/ultrawork-state.json`, `~/.claude/ultrawork-state.json`
- Ultrawork mode now persists across stop attempts when todos remain incomplete
- Ralph-loop continues with iteration tracking and reinforcement messages

  - Fixed ultrawork skill to remove JavaScript wrapper code (clean prompt only)

- **Template escaping**
  - Properly escaped backticks, template literals (`${}`), and backslashes in all skill templates
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors due to improper template string escaping

- **SDK adaptation**
  - Converted all oh-my-opencode SDK patterns to Claude Code SDK:
    - `sisyphus_task()` → `Task(subagent_type=...)`
    - `background_output()` → `TaskOutput()`
    - References to OhMyOpenCode → Oh-My-ClaudeCode-Sisyphus

### Verified

- All 6 builtin skills install correctly to `~/.claude/skills/`
- Orchestrator skill properly delegates with `Task(subagent_type=...)`
- Ultrawork skill contains clean verification guarantees and zero-tolerance failures
