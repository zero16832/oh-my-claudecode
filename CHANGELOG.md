The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.6.2] - 2026-01-27

### Added

#### Project Session Manager (PSM) Skill
New skill for managing isolated project sessions with automatic context injection.

- **PSM Skill** (`skills/psm/`)
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:psm` command for project session management
  - Automatic CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md injection on session start
  - Project isolation with dedicated session contexts
  - Session persistence and resume support
  - Integration with existing oh-my-claudecode workflows

### Changed

- Updated skill count: 40 → 41 (added psm)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

#### SQLite-based Swarm Coordination (Major Feature)
Production-ready multi-agent task coordination with atomic claiming and transaction isolation.

- **SQLite Database Backend** (`src/hooks/swarm/`)
  - Atomic task claiming with IMMEDIATE transaction mode
  - Lease-based ownership with 5-minute timeout
  - Heartbeat monitoring for agent health
  - Stale claim cleanup with automatic release
  - WAL mode for concurrent read access

- **Mode Registry** (`src/hooks/mode-registry/`)
  - Centralized mode state detection via file-based approach
  - Mutual exclusion between exclusive modes (autopilot, ultrapilot, swarm, pipeline)
  - Stale marker detection with 1-hour auto-removal
  - Marker file management for SQLite-based modes

- **Worker Preamble Protocol** (`src/agents/preamble.ts`)
  - Prevents worker agents from spawning their own sub-agents
  - Ensures agents use tools directly (Read, Write, Edit, Bash)
  - Requires agents to report results with absolute file paths
  - Documented in AGENTS.md

- **Ultrapilot Decomposer** (`src/hooks/ultrapilot/decomposer.ts`)
  - AI-powered task decomposition for parallel execution
  - File ownership assignment with non-overlapping patterns
  - Dependency tracking and execution order calculation

- **37 new tests** across 3 test files for swarm coordination

### Changed

#### State File Standardization
All execution mode state files consolidated into `.omc/state/` subdirectory:
- `autopilot-state.json`
- `ralph-state.json`
- `ultrawork-state.json`
- `ultraqa-state.json`
- `ultrapilot-state.json`
- `swarm.db` (SQLite database)
- `pipeline-state.json`
- `ecomode-state.json`

#### Skill Files Updated
All skill files now include explicit "STATE CLEANUP ON COMPLETION" sections instructing to delete state files rather than just setting `active: false`.

### Fixed

- **Path consistency**: Fixed path mismatches between mode-registry and cancel skill
- **Transaction isolation**: All 6 swarm transactions use `.immediate()` for proper write locking
- **Init error handling**: `cleanupOnFailure()` prevents leftover state on initialization errors

### Technical Details

**New Files:**
- `src/hooks/swarm/index.ts` - Main swarm coordination module
- `src/hooks/swarm/state.ts` - SQLite state management
- `src/hooks/swarm/claiming.ts` - Atomic task claiming

## [3.5.1] - 2026-01-24

### Added

#### Learned Skills Auto-Matching & Invocation System

- **Skill Matcher** (`src/hooks/learner/matcher.ts`)
  - Fuzzy matching using Levenshtein distance
  - Glob and regex pattern support for triggers
  - Context extraction (errors, files, code patterns)
  - Confidence scoring (0-100) for match quality

- **Auto-Learner** (`src/hooks/learner/auto-learner.ts`)
  - Pattern detection from problem-solution pairs
  - Skill worthiness scoring algorithm
  - Auto-trigger extraction from conversation context
  - Suggestion threshold (70+ confidence)

- **Auto-Invoke** (`src/hooks/learner/auto-invoke.ts`)
  - High-confidence auto-invocation (80+ threshold)
  - Session tracking with cooldown to prevent spam
  - Success/failure analytics for learning

- **New Skills**
  - `local-skills-setup` - Guided wizard for skill directory setup and management
  - `skill` - CLI commands for list/add/remove/edit/search/sync local skills

- **90 new tests** for matcher, auto-learner edge cases, security, and performance

#### Analytics Backfill System
Complete offline transcript analysis pipeline for token usage and cost tracking.

- **Transcript Scanner** (`src/analytics/transcript-scanner.ts`)
  - Scans `~/.claude/projects/` for session JSONL files
  - Smart path decoding handles hyphenated directory names
  - Project filtering and date range support

- **Transcript Parser** (`src/analytics/transcript-parser.ts`)
  - Streaming JSONL parser with AbortSignal support
  - Memory-efficient line-by-line processing
  - Graceful handling of malformed entries

- **Token Extractor** (`src/analytics/transcript-token-extractor.ts`)
  - Extracts token usage from both `assistant` and `progress` entry types
  - **Proper agent attribution**: Progress entries (actual agent responses) correctly attributed via `parentToolUseID` → `toolUseId` lookup
  - Model normalization (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 → claude-sonnet-4.5)
  - Haiku model detection from progress entries
  - Skips `<synthetic>` model entries

- **Backfill Engine** (`src/analytics/backfill-engine.ts`)
  - Orchestrates the full pipeline: scan → parse → extract → deduplicate → store
  - Progress events for UI feedback
  - Batch processing with configurable batch size
  - Dry-run mode for testing

- **Backfill Deduplication** (`src/analytics/backfill-dedup.ts`)
  - SHA256-based entry ID generation for consistent deduplication
  - Persistent state in `~/.omc/state/backfill-state.json`
  - Prevents duplicate entries on re-runs

- **CLI Command** (`omc backfill`)
  - Progress bar with real-time stats
  - Options: `--project`, `--from`, `--to`, `--dry-run`, `--verbose`
  - Auto-backfill on first `omc stats` run

- **Global Token Tracking**
  - All token data stored globally in `~/.omc/state/` (not per-project)
  - Cross-session aggregate statistics via `getAllStats()`
  - Proper "(main session)" attribution for non-agent token usage

- **Documentation** (`docs/ANALYTICS-SYSTEM.md`)
  - Complete system architecture documentation
  - Data flow diagrams and file format specifications

### Fixed

- **Agent Cost Attribution**: Previously spawned agent costs were hidden in "(main session)" because progress entries weren't properly attributed. Now correctly shows:
  - Main session: ~60% of cost (direct user interactions)
  - Spawned agents: ~40% of cost (delegated work)

- **Haiku Model Detection**: Haiku responses stored as `type: "progress"` entries with nested `data.message.message.usage` are now properly detected

- **Model Name Normalization**: Handles full model names (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) and normalizes to pricing tiers

### Technical Details

**Agent Attribution Fix:**
```
Before: Assistant entries with Task calls → incorrectly attributed to agent
        Progress entries (actual agent work) → hidden in "(main session)"

After:  Assistant entries → correctly attributed to "(main session)"
        Progress entries → correctly attributed via parentToolUseID lookup
```

  - `document-writer` → `writer` (technical documentation)
  - `multimodal-looker` → `vision` (visual analysis)
  - `orchestrator-sisyphus` → `orchestrator` (task coordination)

- **Directory Structure**: `.sisyphus/` → `.omc/` (oh-my-claudecode)
  - State files now in `~/.claude/.omc/`
  - Runtime plans in `.omc/plans/`
  - Session notes in `.omc/notepads/`

- **Environment Variables**: `SISYPHUS_*` → `OMC_*`
  - All environment variable prefixes updated for consistency

- **Slash Commands Updated**: Agent-referencing commands now use new names
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:plan` now uses `planner` agent (was `prometheus`)
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:review` now uses `critic` agent (was `momus`)
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:mnemosyne` → `/oh-my-claudecode:learner` for skill extraction

### Migration Guide

For existing users upgrading from 2.x:

1. **Reinstall**: Run `npx oh-my-claude-sisyphus install` to update hooks and configs
2. **State Migration**: Old `.sisyphus/` directories will continue to work, but new state saves to `.omc/`
3. **Agent References**: Update any custom scripts/configs that referenced old agent names
4. **Environment Variables**: Rename any `SISYPHUS_*` variables to `OMC_*`

### Rationale

The Greek mythology naming convention, while elegant, created barriers for new users:
- Non-obvious agent purposes ("What does Prometheus do?")
- Cultural accessibility concerns
- Increased cognitive load for remembering agent roles

The new intuitive names (`planner`, `architect`, `critic`) make the system immediately understandable.

### Note on Historical Entries

All changelog entries below v3.0.0 reference the old names (`prometheus`, `sisyphus-junior`, etc.) - this is intentional and accurate for those versions.

  - Interactive CLI testing using tmux sessions
  - Prerequisite checking (tmux availability, server connections)
  - Structured test execution workflow
  - Oracle → QA-Tester diagnostic loop pattern

- **Smart Gating for qa-tester** in ultrawork/skills
  - Prefer standard test suites over qa-tester when available
  - Use qa-tester only when interactive testing is truly needed
  - Token-efficient verification decisions

- **Adaptive Routing for qa-tester**
  - Simple verification → Haiku
  - Interactive testing → Sonnet
  - Complex integration → Opus

### Changed

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-01-13

### 🚀 Revolutionary: Intelligent Model Routing

**This is a major release introducing adaptive model routing for all agents.**

The orchestrator (Opus) now analyzes task complexity BEFORE delegation and routes to the appropriate model tier (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus). This dramatically improves efficiency - simple tasks use faster, cheaper models while complex tasks get the full power of Opus.

### Added
- **Intelligent Model Routing System** (`src/features/model-routing/`)
  - `types.ts`: Core types for routing (ComplexityTier, RoutingDecision, etc.)
  - `signals.ts`: Complexity signal extraction (lexical, structural, context)
  - `scorer.ts`: Weighted scoring system for complexity calculation
  - `rules.ts`: Priority-based routing rules engine
  - `router.ts`: Main routing logic with `getModelForTask()` API
  - `prompts/`: Tier-specific prompt adaptations (opus.ts, sonnet.ts, haiku.ts)

- **Adaptive Routing for ALL Agents**
  - Only orchestrators are fixed to Opus (they analyze and delegate)
  - All other agents adapt based on task complexity:
    - `oracle`: lookup → Haiku, tracing → Sonnet, debugging → Opus
    - `prometheus`: breakdown → Haiku, planning → Sonnet, strategic → Opus
    - `momus`: checklist → Haiku, gap analysis → Sonnet, adversarial → Opus
    - `metis`: impact → Haiku, deps → Sonnet, risk analysis → Opus
    - `explore`: simple search → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `document-writer`: simple docs → Haiku, complex → Sonnet
    - `sisyphus-junior`: simple fix → Haiku, module work → Sonnet, risky → Opus

- **Complexity Signal Detection**
  - Lexical: word count, keywords (architecture, debugging, risk, simple)
  - Structural: subtask count, cross-file deps, impact scope, reversibility
  - Context: previous failures, conversation depth, plan complexity

- **Tiered Prompt Adaptations**
  - Haiku: Concise, direct prompts for speed
  - Sonnet: Balanced prompts for efficiency
  - Opus: Deep reasoning prompts with thinking mode

### Changed
- **Orchestrator Prompts** updated with intelligent routing guidance
- **Configuration** (`src/config/loader.ts`) now includes routing options
- **Types** (`src/shared/types.ts`) extended with routing configuration

### Breaking Changes
- Routing is now proactive (orchestrator decides upfront) instead of reactive
- Deprecated `routeWithEscalation()` - use `getModelForTask()` instead

### Migration Guide
No action needed - the system automatically routes based on complexity. To override:
```typescript
Task(subagent_type="oracle", model="opus", prompt="Force Opus for this task")
```

## [1.11.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Enhanced Hook Enforcement System** - Stronger Sisyphus behavior enforcement beyond CLAUDE.md
  - `pre-tool-enforcer.sh`: PreToolUse hook that injects contextual Sisyphus reminders before every tool execution
  - `post-tool-verifier.sh`: PostToolUse hook for verification after tools, with failure detection
  - Enhanced `persistent-mode.sh`: Stop hook now includes build/test/git/background task verification
  - `claude-sisyphus.sh`: CLI wrapper that uses `--append-system-prompt` for direct system prompt injection
  - `sisyphus-aliases.sh`: Shell aliases (`claude-s`, `claudew`) for easy activation

### Changed
- **Stop Hook** now enforces additional verification requirements:
  - Build verification (if build scripts exist)
  - Test verification (if tests exist)
  - Git status check (warns on uncommitted changes)
  - Background task completion check
  - All previous checks (Ralph Loop, Ultrawork, Todo completion)

- **Hook Configuration** - Added PreToolUse and PostToolUse to `hooks.json`

### Technical Details
- PreToolUse hook provides tool-specific reminders (Bash, Task, Edit, Write, Read, Grep/Glob)
- PostToolUse hook tracks session statistics in `~/.claude/.session-stats.json`
- Stop hook returns `continue: false` until ALL verification requirements are met
- CLI wrapper appends core Sisyphus rules directly to Claude's system prompt

### Enforcement Hierarchy
1. **Stop Hook** with `continue: false` - Blocks ALL stopping until verified
2. **PreToolUse** - Injects reminders BEFORE every tool
3. **PostToolUse** - Verifies AFTER every tool
4. **CLI Wrapper** - Appends rules to system prompt

## [1.10.0] - 2026-01-11

  - Conventional commit message validation
  - TypeScript type checking integration
  - Test runner detection and execution
  - Pre-commit validation workflow

### Changed
- **Bridge Module** - Added persistent-mode and session-start hook handlers

- **Settings Configuration** - Added SessionStart hook configuration for both Bash and Node.js

### Technical Details
- New hooks: `persistent-mode.sh/.mjs`, `session-start.sh/.mjs`
- State files: `.sisyphus/ultrawork-state.json`, `~/.claude/ultrawork-state.json`
- Ultrawork mode now persists across stop attempts when todos remain incomplete
- Ralph-loop continues with iteration tracking and reinforcement messages

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-10

  - Fixed agent path for prometheus from `'prometheus/skill.md'` to `'prometheus.md'`
  - Added directory creation for both commands and skills to prevent ENOENT errors
  - Fixed ultrawork skill to remove JavaScript wrapper code (clean prompt only)

- **Template escaping**
  - Properly escaped backticks, template literals (`${}`), and backslashes in all skill templates
  - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors due to improper template string escaping

- **SDK adaptation**
  - Converted all oh-my-opencode SDK patterns to Claude Code SDK:
    - `sisyphus_task()` → `Task(subagent_type=...)`
    - `background_output()` → `TaskOutput()`
    - References to OhMyOpenCode → Oh-My-ClaudeCode-Sisyphus

### Verified
- All 6 builtin skills install correctly to `~/.claude/skills/`
- Orchestrator skill properly delegates with `Task(subagent_type=...)`
- Ultrawork skill contains clean verification guarantees and zero-tolerance failures
- Build completes without TypeScript errors
