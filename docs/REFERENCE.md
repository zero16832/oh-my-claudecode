## Installation

**Only the Claude Code Plugin method is supported.** Other installation methods (npm, bun, curl) are deprecated and may not work correctly.

### Claude Code Plugin (Required)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode

# Step 2: Install the plugin
/plugin install oh-my-claudecode
```

This integrates directly with Claude Code's plugin system and uses Node.js hooks.

> **Note**: Direct npm/bun global installs are **not supported**. The plugin system handles all installation and hook setup automatically.

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) installed
- One of:
  - **Claude Max/Pro subscription** (recommended for individuals)
  - **Anthropic API key** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable)

---

## Configuration

### Project-Scoped Configuration (Recommended)

Configure omc for the current project only:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup
```

- Creates `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your current project
- Configuration applies only to this project
- Won't affect other projects or global settings
- **Safe**: Preserves your global CLAUDE.md

### Global Configuration

Configure omc for all Claude Code sessions:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup
```

- Creates `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` globally
- Configuration applies to all projects
- **Warning**: Completely overwrites existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

### What Configuration Enables

| Feature | Without | With omc Config |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Agent delegation | Manual only | Automatic based on task |
| Keyword detection | Disabled | ultrawork, search, analyze |
| Todo continuation | Basic | Enforced completion |
| Model routing | Default | Smart tier selection |
| Skill composition | None | Auto-combines skills |

### Configuration Precedence

If both configurations exist, **project-scoped takes precedence** over global:

```
./.claude/CLAUDE.md  (project)   →  Overrides  →  ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md  (global)
```

### When to Re-run Setup

- **First time**: Run after installation (choose project or global)
- **After updates**: Re-run to get the latest configuration
- **Different machines**: Run on each machine where you use Claude Code
- **New projects**: Run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup --local` in each project that needs omc

> **NOTE**: After updating the plugin (via `npm update`, `git pull`, or Claude Code's plugin update), you MUST re-run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup` to apply the latest CLAUDE.md changes.

### Agent Customization

Edit agent files in `~/.claude/agents/` to customize behavior:

```yaml
---
name: architect
description: Your custom description
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit
model: opus  # or sonnet, haiku
---

Your custom system prompt here...
```

### Project-Level Config

Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project for project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Project Context

This is a TypeScript monorepo using:
- Bun runtime
- React for frontend
- PostgreSQL database

## Conventions
- Use functional components
- All API routes in /src/api
- Tests alongside source files
```

---

## Agents (32 Total)

Always use `oh-my-claudecode:` prefix when calling via Task tool.

## Troubleshooting

### Diagnose Installation Issues

```bash
/oh-my-claudecode:doctor
```

Checks for:
- Missing dependencies
- Configuration errors
- Hook installation status
- Agent availability
- Skill registration

### Configure HUD Statusline

```bash
/oh-my-claudecode:hud setup
```

Installs or repairs the HUD statusline for real-time status updates.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Commands not found | Re-run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup` |
| Hooks not executing | Check hook permissions: `chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/**/*.sh` |
| Agents not delegating | Verify CLAUDE.md is loaded: check `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` |
| LSP tools not working | Install language servers: `npm install -g typescript-language-server` |
| Token limit errors | Use `/oh-my-claudecode:ecomode` for token-efficient execution |

### Auto-Update

Oh-my-claudecode includes a silent auto-update system that checks for updates in the background.

Features:
- **Rate-limited**: Checks at most once every 24 hours
- **Concurrent-safe**: Lock file prevents simultaneous update attempts
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both macOS and Linux

To manually update, re-run the plugin install command or use Claude Code's built-in update mechanism.

### Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/agents/{architect,researcher,explore,designer,writer,vision,critic,analyst,executor,qa-tester}.md
rm ~/.claude/commands/{analyze,autopilot,deepsearch,plan,review,ultrawork}.md
```
