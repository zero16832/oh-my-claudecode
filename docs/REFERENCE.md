## Installation

**Only the Claude Code Plugin method is supported.** Other installation methods (npm, bun, curl) are deprecated and may not work correctly.

### Claude Code Plugin (Required)

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode

# Step 2: Install the plugin
/plugin install oh-my-claudecode
```

This integrates directly with Claude Code's plugin system and uses Node.js hooks.

> **Note**: Direct npm/bun global installs are **not supported**. The plugin system handles all installation and hook setup automatically.

### Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) installed
- One of:
  - **Claude Max/Pro subscription** (recommended for individuals)
  - **Anthropic API key** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable)

---

## Configuration

### Project-Scoped Configuration (Recommended)

Configure omc for the current project only:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup --local
```

- Creates `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your current project
- Configuration applies only to this project
- Won't affect other projects or global settings
- **Safe**: Preserves your global CLAUDE.md

### Global Configuration

Configure omc for all Claude Code sessions:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup
```

- Creates `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` globally
- Configuration applies to all projects
- **Warning**: Completely overwrites existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

### What Configuration Enables

| Feature | Without | With omc Config |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Agent delegation | Manual only | Automatic based on task |
| Keyword detection | Disabled | ultrawork, search, analyze |
| Todo continuation | Basic | Enforced completion |
| Model routing | Default | Smart tier selection |
| Skill composition | None | Auto-combines skills |

### Configuration Precedence

If both configurations exist, **project-scoped takes precedence** over global:

```
./.claude/CLAUDE.md  (project)   →  Overrides  →  ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md  (global)
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OMC_STATE_DIR` | _(unset)_ | Centralized state directory. When set, OMC stores state at `$OMC_STATE_DIR/{project-id}/` instead of `{worktree}/.omc/`. This preserves state across worktree deletions. The project identifier is derived from the git remote URL (or worktree path for local-only repos). |
| `OMC_BRIDGE_SCRIPT` | _(auto-detected)_ | Path to the Python bridge script |
| `OMC_PARALLEL_EXECUTION` | `true` | Enable/disable parallel agent execution |
| `OMC_CODEX_DEFAULT_MODEL` | _(provider default)_ | Default model for Codex CLI workers |
| `OMC_GEMINI_DEFAULT_MODEL` | _(provider default)_ | Default model for Gemini CLI workers |
| `DISABLE_OMC` | _(unset)_ | Set to any value to disable all OMC hooks |
| `OMC_SKIP_HOOKS` | _(unset)_ | Comma-separated list of hook names to skip |

#### Centralized State with `OMC_STATE_DIR`

By default, OMC stores state in `{worktree}/.omc/`. This is lost when worktrees are deleted. To preserve state across worktree lifecycles, set `OMC_STATE_DIR`:

```bash
# In your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
export OMC_STATE_DIR="$HOME/.claude/omc"
```

This resolves to `~/.claude/omc/{project-identifier}/` where the project identifier uses a hash of the git remote URL (stable across worktrees/clones) with a fallback to the directory path hash for local-only repos.

If both a legacy `{worktree}/.omc/` directory and a centralized directory exist, OMC logs a notice and uses the centralized directory. You can then migrate data from the legacy directory and remove it.

### When to Re-run Setup

- **First time**: Run after installation (choose project or global)
- **After updates**: Re-run to get the latest configuration
- **Different machines**: Run on each machine where you use Claude Code
- **New projects**: Run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup --local` in each project that needs omc

> **NOTE**: After updating the plugin (via `npm update`, `git pull`, or Claude Code's plugin update), you MUST re-run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-setup` to apply the latest CLAUDE.md changes.

### Agent Customization

Edit agent files in `~/.claude/agents/` to customize behavior:

```yaml
---
name: architect
description: Your custom description
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit
model: opus  # or sonnet, haiku
---

Your custom system prompt here...
```

### Project-Level Config

Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project for project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Project Context

This is a TypeScript monorepo using:
- Bun runtime
- React for frontend
- PostgreSQL database

## Conventions
- Use functional components
- All API routes in /src/api
- Tests alongside source files
```

### Stop Callback Notification Tags

Configure tags for Telegram/Discord stop callbacks with `omc config-stop-callback`.

```bash
# Set/replace tags
omc config-stop-callback telegram --enable --token <bot_token> --chat <chat_id> --tag-list "@alice,bob"
omc config-stop-callback discord --enable --webhook <url> --tag-list "@here,123456789012345678,role:987654321098765432"

# Incremental updates
omc config-stop-callback telegram --add-tag charlie
omc config-stop-callback discord --remove-tag @here
omc config-stop-callback discord --clear-tags

# Inspect current callback config
omc config-stop-callback telegram --show
omc config-stop-callback discord --show
```

Tag behavior:
- Telegram: `alice` is normalized to `@alice`
- Discord: supports `@here`, `@everyone`, numeric user IDs (`<@id>`), and role tags (`role:<id>` -> `<@&id>`)
- `file` callbacks ignore tag options

## Hooks System

Oh-my-claudecode includes 31 lifecycle hooks that enhance Claude Code's behavior.

### Execution Mode Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `autopilot` | Full autonomous execution from idea to working code |
| `ultrawork` | Maximum parallel agent execution |
| `ralph` | Persistence until verified complete |
| `ultrapilot` | Parallel autopilot with file ownership |
| `team-pipeline` | Native team staged pipeline orchestration |
| `ultraqa` | QA cycling until goal met |
| `swarm` | Coordinated multi-agent with SQLite task claiming |
| `mode-registry` | Tracks active execution mode state (including team/ralph/ultrawork/ralplan) |
| `persistent-mode` | Maintains mode state across sessions |

### Core Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rules-injector` | Dynamic rules injection with YAML frontmatter parsing |
| `omc-orchestrator` | Enforces orchestrator behavior and delegation |
| `auto-slash-command` | Automatic slash command detection and execution |
| `keyword-detector` | Magic keyword detection (ultrawork, ralph, etc.) |
| `todo-continuation` | Ensures todo list completion |
| `notepad` | Compaction-resilient memory system |
| `learner` | Skill extraction from conversations |

### Context & Recovery

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `recovery` | Edit error, session, and context window recovery |
| `preemptive-compaction` | Context usage monitoring to prevent limits |
| `pre-compact` | Pre-compaction processing |
| `directory-readme-injector` | README context injection |

### Quality & Validation

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `comment-checker` | BDD detection and directive filtering |
| `thinking-block-validator` | Extended thinking validation |
| `empty-message-sanitizer` | Empty message handling |
| `permission-handler` | Permission requests and validation |
| `think-mode` | Extended thinking detection |
| `code-simplifier` | Auto-simplify recently modified files on Stop (opt-in) |

### Code Simplifier Hook

The `code-simplifier` Stop hook automatically delegates recently modified source files to the
`code-simplifier` agent after each Claude turn. It is **disabled by default** and must be
explicitly enabled via `~/.omc/config.json`.

**Enable:**
```json
{
  "codeSimplifier": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

**Full config options:**
```json
{
  "codeSimplifier": {
    "enabled": true,
    "extensions": [".ts", ".tsx", ".js", ".jsx", ".py", ".go", ".rs"],
    "maxFiles": 10
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Opt-in to automatic simplification |
| `extensions` | `string[]` | `[".ts",".tsx",".js",".jsx",".py",".go",".rs"]` | File extensions to consider |
| `maxFiles` | `number` | `10` | Maximum files simplified per turn |

**How it works:**
1. When Claude stops, the hook runs `git diff HEAD --name-only` to find modified files
2. If modified source files are found, the hook injects a message asking Claude to delegate to the `code-simplifier` agent
3. The agent simplifies the files for clarity and consistency without changing behavior
4. A turn-scoped marker prevents the hook from triggering more than once per turn cycle

### Coordination & Environment

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `subagent-tracker` | Tracks spawned sub-agents |
| `session-end` | Session termination handling |
| `non-interactive-env` | CI/non-interactive environment handling |
| `agent-usage-reminder` | Reminder to use specialized agents |
| `background-notification` | Background task completion notifications |
| `plugin-patterns` | Plugin pattern detection |
| `setup` | Initial setup and configuration |
