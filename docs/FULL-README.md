## ⚡ NEW in 3.0: HUD Statusline, Learned Skills & Enhanced Orchestration

**Game-changing release:** Claude never forgets critical project knowledge, even through context compaction.

### 🧠 Three-Tier Memory System

**The Problem:** Long sessions lose context through compaction. Critical discoveries vanish.

**The Solution:** Persistent notepad system that survives compaction:

| Tier | Purpose | Retention |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Priority Context** | Critical discoveries (API URLs, key files) | Always loaded on session start |
| **Working Memory** | Session notes with timestamps | Auto-pruned after 7 days |
| **MANUAL** | User permanent notes | Never pruned |

```bash
# Agents can persist discoveries automatically
<remember>Project uses pnpm not npm</remember>
<remember priority>API client at src/api/client.ts</remember>

# Or save notes manually
/oh-my-claudecode:note Database schema uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
```

### 📋 Ralph Loop PRD Support

**Structured task tracking** inspired by [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph):

- **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** format with user stories
- **Progress tracking** with learnings and patterns
- **Completion guarantee** - loop continues until ALL stories pass
- **Three powerful modes:**
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:ralph` - Self-referential loop until completion
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:ultrawork` + `/oh-my-claudecode:ralph` - Maximum intensity + completion guarantee
  - `/oh-my-claudecode:ultraqa` - Autonomous test-verify-fix cycles

```bash
# Initialize a structured task
/oh-my-claudecode:ralph-init implement user authentication with OAuth

# Maximum intensity with completion guarantee
/oh-my-claudecode:ultrawork refactor the entire API layer

# Autonomous QA cycling
/oh-my-claudecode:ultraqa all tests must pass with 90%+ coverage
```

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

## NEW in 3.1: oh-my-opencode Integration

The following features were integrated from oh-my-opencode to enhance orchestration capabilities:

### Notepad Wisdom System

Plan-scoped wisdom capture for persistent learnings, decisions, issues, and problems. Stores wisdom in `.omc/notepads/{plan-name}/` with timestamped entries.

**Functions:** `initPlanNotepad()`, `addLearning()`, `addDecision()`, `addIssue()`, `addProblem()`, `getWisdomSummary()`

**Benefits:**
- Separates learnings by plan for better organization
- Automatic timestamp tracking for temporal context
- Structured wisdom capture (learning vs decision vs issue vs problem)
- Persistent storage survives session resets

### Delegation Categories

Semantic task categorization that auto-maps to model tier, temperature, and thinking budget.

**Categories:**
- `visual-engineering` - UI/visual reasoning, frontend work, design systems (Opus, extended thinking)
- `ultrabrain` - Deep reasoning tasks (Opus, maximum thinking)
- `artistry` - Creative writing, novel approaches, innovative solutions (Sonnet, high temperature 0.9)
- `quick` - Simple lookups (Haiku, no thinking)
- `writing` - Documentation and content (Haiku, standard temperature)

**Benefits:**
- Automatic optimal model selection
- Context-aware temperature tuning
- Efficient thinking budget allocation
- Semantic task routing without manual configuration

### Directory Diagnostics

Project-level type checking via `lsp_diagnostics_directory` tool with dual strategy (tsc fast, LSP fallback).

**Capabilities:**
- Scan entire project directory for type errors
- Automatic TypeScript compiler optimization
- Fallback to LSP when tsc unavailable
- Batch processing with progress reporting

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive project health checks
- Performance-optimized with smart strategy selection
- Deep language server integration for accuracy
- Works with or without explicit TypeScript setup

### Session Resume

Background agent resumption with context preservation via `resumeSession()`.

**Capabilities:**
- Automatic session state recovery
- Context preservation across interruptions
- Background agent reconnection
- Graceful degradation on failure

**Benefits:**
- Uninterrupted workflow during agent crashes
- Persistent work state across sessions
- No manual context re-entry needed
- Seamless continuation of complex tasks

---

## Quick Install

Choose **ONE** installation method below. Do not mix methods.

### Option A: Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

```bash
# From terminal:
claude plugin install oh-my-claude-sisyphus

# Or from within Claude Code:
/oh-my-claudecode:plugin oh-my-claude-sisyphus
```

Uses Node.js hooks from the plugin directory. Integrates directly with Claude Code's plugin system.

### Option B: Curl One-Liner (Deprecated)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

> **Deprecated**: This method installs bash hooks to `~/.claude/` which can conflict with plugin installations. Use the plugin method above instead.

### Option C: Via npm (Windows & Cross-Platform)

```bash
npm install -g oh-my-claudecode
```

> **Windows Users**: This is the recommended installation method. Requires Node.js 20+.

> **Important:** Plugin install and curl install are **mutually exclusive**. Using both will cause hook conflicts. Choose one method only.

### Manual Install (macOS/Linux)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claude-sisyphus.git
cd oh-my-claude-sisyphus
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

---

## 🎯 Configuration: Choose Global or Project Scope

**After ANY installation method**, choose how you want to configure omc:

### Option A: Project-Scoped (Recommended)

Configure omc for the current project only:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-default
```

- Creates `./.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your current project
- Configuration applies only to this project
- Won't affect other projects or global settings
- **Safe**: Preserves your global CLAUDE.md

### Option B: Global Configuration

Configure omc for all Claude Code sessions:

```
/oh-my-claudecode:omc-default-global
```

- Creates `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` globally
- Configuration applies to all projects
- **Warning**: Completely overwrites existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

### Why This Matters

Without running one of these commands, Claude operates with basic capabilities. Running either enables:

| Feature | Without | With omc Config |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Agent delegation | Manual only | Automatic based on task |
| Keyword detection | Disabled | ultrawork, search, analyze |
| Todo continuation | Basic | Enforced completion |
| Model routing | Default | Smart tier selection |
| Skill composition | None | Auto-combines skills |

### What These Commands Do

1. ✅ Download latest CLAUDE.md with full omc orchestration prompt
2. ✅ Configure 19 agents with intelligent model routing
3. ✅ Enable magic keyword detection (ultrawork, search, analyze)
4. ✅ Activate continuation enforcement (tasks complete before stopping)
5. ✅ Set up skill composition (orchestrate + ultrawork + git-master, etc.)

### When to Run Them

- **First time**: Run after installation (choose project or global)
- **After updates**: Re-run to get the latest configuration
- **Different machines**: Run on each machine where you use Claude Code
- **New projects**: Run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-default` in each project that needs omc

### Configuration Precedence

If both configurations exist, **project-scoped takes precedence** over global:

```
./.claude/CLAUDE.md  (project)   →  Overrides  →  ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md  (global)
```

> **NOTE**: After updating the plugin (via `npm update`, `git pull`, or Claude Code's plugin update), you MUST re-run `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-default` or `/oh-my-claudecode:omc-default-global` to apply the latest CLAUDE.md changes. The plugin update does NOT automatically update your CLAUDE.md files.

## Intelligent Skill Activation

> **New in v1.11.0**: Enhanced Hook Enforcement System - PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks and strengthened Stop hook for stronger orchestration behavior beyond CLAUDE.md.

### Skill Layers

Skills work in **three composable layers**:

| Layer | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Execution** | orchestrate, orchestrator, planner | HOW you work (pick primary) |
| **Enhancement** | ultrawork, git-master, frontend-ui-ux | ADD capabilities (stack multiple) |
| **Guarantee** | ralph-loop | ENSURE completion |

**Combination Formula:** `[Execution] + [0-N Enhancements] + [Optional Guarantee]`

### Task Type → Skill Selection

Claude uses judgment to detect task type and activate appropriate skill combinations:

| Task Type | Skill Combination | When |
|-----------|-------------------|------|
| Multi-step implementation | `orchestrate` | Building features, refactoring |
| + parallel subtasks | `orchestrate + ultrawork` | 3+ independent subtasks |
| + multi-file changes | `orchestrate + git-master` | Changes span 3+ files |
| + must complete | `orchestrate + ralph-loop` | User emphasizes completion |
| UI/frontend work | `orchestrate + frontend-ui-ux` | Components, styling |
| Complex debugging | `architect` → `orchestrate` | Root cause → fix |
| Strategic planning | `planner` | Need plan first |
| Maximum performance | `ultrawork` (stacks) | Speed critical |

### Examples

```
"Add dark mode with proper commits"
→ orchestrate + frontend-ui-ux + git-master

"ultrawork: refactor the entire API layer"
→ ultrawork + orchestrate + git-master

"Plan auth system, then implement it completely"
→ planner (first) → orchestrate + ralph-loop (after plan)

"Fix this bug, don't stop until it's done"
→ orchestrate + ralph-loop
```

---

## The Twelve Agents

Claude will automatically delegate to these specialized agents:

### Task Execution

| | Agent | Model | Best For |
|---|-------|-------|----------|
| **architect** | Opus | Complex debugging, architecture decisions, root cause analysis |
| **researcher** | Sonnet | Finding documentation, understanding code organization |
| **explore** | Haiku | Quick file searches, pattern matching, reconnaissance |
| **designer** | Sonnet | UI components, styling, accessibility |
| **writer** | Haiku | README files, API docs, code comments |
| **vision** | Sonnet | Analyzing screenshots, diagrams, mockups |
| **qa-tester** | Sonnet | Interactive CLI/service testing with tmux |

### Planning & Review

| | Agent | Model | Best For |
|---|-------|-------|----------|
| **planner** | Opus | Strategic planning, comprehensive work plans, interview-style requirement gathering |
| **critic** | Opus | Critical plan review, feasibility assessment, risk identification |
| **analyst** | Opus | Pre-planning analysis, hidden requirement detection, ambiguity resolution |

### Orchestration

| | Agent | Model | Best For |
|---|-------|-------|----------|
| **orchestrator** | Opus | Master todo coordination, complex multi-step task management |
| **executor** | Sonnet | Focused task execution, plan following, direct implementation |

### Manual Agent Invocation

You can explicitly request an agent:

```
Use the architect agent to debug the memory leak in the worker process

Have the researcher find all documentation about the API

Ask explore to find all TypeScript files that import React
```

---

## Configuration

### Project-Level Config

Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md` in your project for project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Project Context

This is a TypeScript monorepo using:
- Bun runtime
- React for frontend
- PostgreSQL database

## Conventions
- Use functional components
- All API routes in /src/api
- Tests alongside source files
```

### Agent Customization

Edit agent files in `~/.claude/agents/` to customize behavior:

```yaml
---
name: architect
description: Your custom description
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Edit
model: opus  # or sonnet, haiku
---

Your custom system prompt here...
```

---

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | bash
```

Or manually:

```bash
rm ~/.claude/agents/{architect,researcher,explore,designer,writer,vision,critic,analyst,executor,planner,qa-tester}.md
rm ~/.claude/commands/{orchestrate,omc-default,omc-default-global,ultrawork,deepsearch,analyze,plan,review,planner,orchestrator,ralph-loop,cancel-ralph}.md
```

---

## SDK Usage (Advanced)

For programmatic use with the Claude Agent SDK:

```bash
npm install oh-my-claudecode @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
```

```typescript
import { createOmcSession } from 'oh-my-claudecode';
import { query } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';

const session = createOmcSession();

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: session.processPrompt("ultrawork implement feature X"),
  ...session.queryOptions
})) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

---

## How It Works

```

└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
```

1. **Orchestrator**: The main Claude instance coordinates all work
2. **Specialized Subagents**: Each agent has focused expertise and tools
3. **Parallel Execution**: Independent tasks run concurrently
4. **Continuation Enforcement**: Agents persist until ALL tasks complete
5. **Context Injection**: Project-specific instructions from CLAUDE.md files

<details>
<summary><h2>Differences from oh-my-opencode</h2></summary>

This project is inspired by [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode), reimagined for Claude Code with skill composition, intelligent model routing, and native integration. Here's what's different:

### Model Mapping

The original oh-my-opencode used multiple AI providers. This project uses Claude models exclusively:

| Agent | Original Model | Ported Model | Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **orchestrator** | Claude Opus 4.5 | Claude Opus 4.5 | Same |
| **architect** | GPT-5.2 | Claude Opus | Was OpenAI's flagship for deep reasoning |
| **researcher** | Claude Sonnet or Gemini 3 Flash | Claude Sonnet | Multi-provider → Claude only |
| **explore** | Grok Code or Gemini 3 Flash | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fast/cheap model for quick searches |
| **designer** | Gemini 3 Pro | Claude Sonnet | Was Google's model |
| **writer** | Gemini 3 Flash | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fast model for docs |
| **vision** | Various | Claude Sonnet | Visual analysis |
| **critic** | GPT-5.2 | Claude Opus | Plan reviewer |
| **analyst** | Claude Opus 4.5 | Claude Opus | Pre-planning consultant |
| **executor** | Configurable | Claude Sonnet | Focused task executor |
| **planner** | Planning System | Claude Opus | Strategic planner |

**Why Claude-only?** The Claude Agent SDK is designed for Claude models. Using Claude throughout provides:
- Consistent behavior and capabilities
- Simpler authentication (single API key)
- Native integration with Claude Code's tools

**Key Architectural Changes:**

1. **Plugin → Native Integration**: Original was an OpenCode plugin; this uses Claude Code's native agent/command system
2. **Multi-Provider → Single Provider**: Simplified to Claude-only for consistency
3. **Custom Runtime → Claude Code Runtime**: Leverages Claude Code's built-in capabilities
4. **Programmatic Config → Markdown Files**: Agents defined as `.md` files in `~/.claude/agents/`

### What You Gain

- **Simpler Setup**: One curl command vs. multi-step plugin installation
- **Native Integration**: Works directly with Claude Code, no plugin layer
- **Consistent Behavior**: All agents use Claude, no cross-model quirks
- **Easier Customization**: Edit markdown files to customize agents

### What You Lose

- **Model Diversity**: Can't use GPT-5.2 for architect's deep reasoning
- **Advanced Hooks**: Fewer lifecycle interception points (22 hooks → system prompt enforcement)

### Migration Tips

If you're coming from oh-my-opencode:

1. **Architect Tasks**: Claude Opus handles architecture/debugging well, but differently than GPT-5.2
2. **LSP Workflows**: All LSP tools are available! Use `lsp_servers` to check which servers are installed
3. **AST Searches**: Use `ast_grep_search` with pattern syntax (e.g., `function $NAME($$$)`)
4. **Background Tasks**: Claude Code's `Task` tool with `run_in_background` works similarly
5. **Planning**: Use `/oh-my-claudecode:plan` command to start a planning session with planner
